                <p> <span class="first">B</span>illy Martin never would have brought up the fact that he reached the quarterfinals
                    at Wimbledon in 1977. But when his son suggested that the two of them go to Wimbledon, Martin explained
                    that, as a former quarterfinalist, he’d received – and turned down – many invitations to sit in the tournament’s
                    prestigious Royal Box.</p>


                <p> “I was like, ‘You never told me this?’” Travis Martin said.</p>


                <p> But it’s nothing new for Travis Martin to hear about his father's playing days in roundabout ways. Every
                    time they attend a tennis event, where everyone knows Billy Martin, Travis Martin finds out more about
                    his dad’s career.</p>

                <p> “We can’t even walk through a room without having to stop to talk to every single person,” Travis Martin
                    said. “I’m there and I’m hearing stuff and I’m like, ‘What the heck? He would never tell me that.’”</p>

                <p> Sometimes, when his son asks, Billy Martin will share a brief clip of his playing career, only to quickly
                    change the subject.</p>

                <p> Through the years, though, Travis Martin, now a junior on the men’s tennis team, has pieced together his
                    father’s story.</p>

                <p>Billy Martin enjoyed an illustrious amateur career that led Inside Tennis Magazine to name him the Junior
                    Tennis Player of the Century. He was the national 14-and-under champion at 13, the 16-and-under champion
                    at 15 and the 18-and-under champion at 17.</p>

                <p> After high school, Martin headed to UCLA, earning comparisons to Jimmy Connors as he led the Bruins to a
                    national championship and won the NCAA singles title as a freshman.</p>
